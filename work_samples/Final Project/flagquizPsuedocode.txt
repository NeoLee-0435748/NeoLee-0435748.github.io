  Title: Flag Quiz
  The user will be allowed to launch another web page via a link or button on the main page, 
  which will present a Flags quiz in the same tab as the original page. 
  This quiz will randomly show a country’s flag, 
  present a drop-downwith the correct country and three other random country names, shown in random order, 
  and allow the user to submit their choice. 
  The user will be immediately informed of their updated score after each guess via a score progress output on the page. 
  The user will be taken through a quiz of 10 questions, 
  and will have buttons to cancel(and close) or restart the quiz at any time.
  
  Once the last quiz question is answered, the user’s final quiz score will be calculated and displayed on screen. 
  Theirscore will be evaluated to see if it is a new high score, 
  through a comparison to values originally loaded from the high-scores.json file, 
  but later updated and maintained in HTML5 local storage in the web browser. 
  If the final score qualifies as a top-5 high score, 
  the user will be prompted to enter their three-letter (e.g. MHC) username, 
  which will be saved as a new high score in local storage. 
  Only the five highest scores are saved, so a new entry will effectively bump the lowest off of the list. 
  The score must be higher than one of the previous entries, 
  so earlier scores “win” in case of a tie (ie. the first 10/10 will be the highest score forever). 
  The username, score, and timestamp will be saved to local storage in the format indicated in the high_scores.json file. 
  Do not forget to drop the lowest score if there is a new entry as we only store 5 highest scores. 
  Regardless of whether there is a new entry or not, 
  the highest scores will then be displayed to the user in a well formatted way, 
  in the area of the web page near the section for guessing a country. 
  The user will still have buttons at the bottom of the page to either cancel (ie. Close) the web page 
  and return to the main page or restart the quiz.
